SilverLingua is a library with the goal of making working with LLMs easier. It seeks to provide a strong but flexible framework for LLMs and associated functionality, such as memory management and tools. By providing this framework, it standardizes and simplifies how LLMs are interacted with, and allows for various plug-and-play behaviors.

SilverLingua is a response to the well intentioned and detailed but clunky and hard to work with LangChain.
